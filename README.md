## ðŸŒ™ Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a meaningful intersection between technology and Deen â€” offering a space where useful Islamic content can be stored, explored, and potentially expanded upon over time. Whether it's educational materials or simple tools to assist with daily spiritual habits, this portal is intended to serve as a quiet companion on the path of remembrance, discipline, and learning.

**May this effort serve as a source of benefit and guidance, and may it be accepted in the sight of Allah SWT.** ðŸ¤²
